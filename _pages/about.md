# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Poornachandra G.

Iâ€™m a **Lead Bioinformatics Scientist** passionate about using genomics, data science, and machine learning to solve some of the toughest challenges in **precision oncology**.

Over the past decade, Iâ€™ve built and scaled **end-to-end NGS and multi-omics pipelines** that power clinical decision-making â€” from raw sequencing data to variant interpretation and downstream biological insights. My work sits at the intersection of **clinical genomics, computational biology, and AI**, where data meets patient impact.

I love turning complex datasets into actionable knowledge. Whether itâ€™s building high-performance pipelines, designing annotation frameworks, or integrating machine learning for biomarker discovery, my focus is always on one thing: **translating biology into better patient outcomes**.

I currently lead the **Bioinformatics R&D team at Cellworks**, where I define the technical roadmap, mentor scientists, and build tools that scale genomic analysis in clinical and research settings. Along the way, Iâ€™ve also explored LLM applications in clinical data mining, built RAG-based chatbots for oncology decision support, and designed multi-agent systems for variant interpretation.

When Iâ€™m not deep in code or biology papers, youâ€™ll probably find me mentoring junior bioinformaticians, exploring new tools in the AI/ML ecosystem, or thinking about how we can make precision medicine more accessible and impactful.

ðŸ’¡ **Letâ€™s connect** â€” Iâ€™m always open to collaborating on challenging bioinformatics problems, building impactful tools, or exchanging ideas on the future of AI in healthcare.
